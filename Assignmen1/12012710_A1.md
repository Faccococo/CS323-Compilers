## Exercise 1

Java programs may contain lexical errors. Please give at least two types of possible lexical errors in Java programs and provide code snippets as examples when possible.

##### Answer:

For example:

```
public class main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	
		int 3a = 134;$
		System.out.println(3a@);
	}
}
```

3a: Spelling Error

$: Illegal character



## Exercise 2

Given a string s, can you find a string x that is both a prefix and a suffix of s? Can you further find a string y that is both a proper prefix and a proper suffix of s? If yes, please provide an example. Otherwise, please explain the reason

##### Answer:

For the first question, the answer is **yes**, since *s* itself is both a prefix and a suffix of *s*.  

For the second question, the answer is **yes**. for any string *s* matches s = $(s_0)^n(n>=2)$, for example *abab*, then $s_0$ is both a proper prefix and a proper suffix of s.



## Exercise 3

In a string of length n (n > 0), how many of the following are there? For simplicity, we assume that the string contains n different characters. Besides giving the final answers, please also explain how you derive the answers. 

1. Substrings of length m (0 < m ≤ n) [15 points]
2. Subsequences [15 points]

##### Answer:

1. $N = 1(s)+2(take\space 1\space symbols\space from\space beginning\space and\space end)+3+...+n(take\space n-1\space symbols\space from\space beginning\space and\space end) + 1(\epsilon) $

   $= \frac{1}{2}(n^2+n)+1$

2. $N = 1(s) + C_n^1(remove\space 1\space symbol) + C_n^2(remove\space 2\space symbol) + ... + C_n^{n-1}(remove\space n-1\space symbol) + C_n^n(\epsilon)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(C_n^k)$



## Exercise 4

Write a regular definition as well as a regular expression to represent all strings of valid telephone numbers in Shenzhen. A valid telephone number contains the country code (86), a hyphen, the area code 755, another hyphen, and eight digits where the first one cannot be zero (e.g., 86-755-88015159). [10 points]

##### Answer:

$(86-755-)(1| ...|9)(0|1|...|9)^7$



## Exercise 5

Given an alphabet Σ = {0, 1}, are the following two regular languages equivalent? Besides saying yes or no, please also prove your answer. [20 points]

1. $L_1 = L((0^∗1^∗)^∗)$
2. $L_2 = L((0|1)^∗ )$

##### Answer:

Yes.

- for a given digit 0: 
  - $L_1$: since $1^*$ can be $\epsilon$, next digit can be 1, 0, and $\epsilon$
  - $L_2$: 0's next digit is $(0|1)^∗$, it can be 1, 0, and $\epsilon$

- for a given digit 1: 
  - $L_1$: since $0^*$ and $(0^∗1^∗)^∗$ can be $\epsilon$, next digit can be 1, 0, and $\epsilon$
  - $L_2$: 0's next digit is $(0|1)^∗$, it can be 1, 0, and $\epsilon$
- for $\epsilon$:
  -  $(0^*1^*)^*$ and $(0|1)^∗$ can both be $\epsilon$

Since for any digits in $\sum$ , next digit in L1 and L2 are totally same, they are **equivalent**.

## Exercise 6

Consider the regular expression $ba^∗ |ab^∗$ . Please provide a state transition diagram that can recognize the strings in the corresponding regular language. Can the transition diagram recognize the string baab? If yes, please give the sequence of state transitions. Otherwise, please explain the reason. [20 points]

It can not. State transitions is：0-1-1-2-failed.
